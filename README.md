# DAG

A Java program to check whether a given graph is a DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph).

[Based on the Wikipidea implementation of Kahn's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm).
A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
